Standard Projection model
========================

Standard Projection model (SPM) for evaluating outcomes of catch control rules for Alaska groundfish

## A simulation approach evaluating set of different fishing scenarios given stock assessment results information 

  1. make directory "data"
  2. edit files within data subdirectory
  3. edit setup.dat (configures number of samples etc)
  4. run using batch file as "run mystock" on windows or "run.sh mystock" on linux/mac (note: linux uses may need to get run.sh to be executable by type "chmod +x run.sh" once

## Key output file
The file 'spm_detail.csv' is ready to read in as a dataframe and should be able to make tables and figures as needed.
