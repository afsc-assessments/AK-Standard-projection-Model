## Standard Projection Model for Alaska Groundfish

This is the standard projection code for federally managed Alaskan groundfish species in Tier 3.

The file src/spm.tpl is the main code for running these projections.
Required input files are spm.dat, tacpar.dat, and a species-specific data input file with key outputs from an assessment, such as examples/data/ai_spm.dat.

Note: spm.dat combines information from two files used in previous versions of the projection code (setup.dat and spp_catch.dat)

ADMB version 13.0 or higher is required to compile spm.tpl.

These are the steps to run the projection code:\
1. Compile src/spm.tpl using admb and copy spm.exe to a a folder with spm.dat, tacpar.dat, and a file containing assessment outputs, such as ai_spm.dat\
2. Within spm.dat specify the location of the assessment input file relative to the folder with spm.exe\
3. From the command line pointed to the folder with these inputs, type "spm"\

The R package `spmR` was developed for doing 
stock projections for groundfish at the AFSC.
The model was coded using the Autodif (`AD`) Model 
Builder (`ADMB`) software.

## Cloning the repository (optional)

The R package `spmR` lives on a public GitHub repository. The repository can be 
cloned to your computer from the command line or using a user interface. From 
the command line using Linux the repository can be cloned using:

``` r
git clone https://github.com/afsc-assessments/spmR
```

## Installation

There are several options for installing the `spmR` R package.

### Option 1

The `spmR` package can be installed from within R using:

``` r
devtools::install_github(repo = "afsc-assessments/spmR", dependencies = TRUE, 
                         build_vignettes = TRUE, auth_token = "your_PAT")
```

### Option 2

The GitHub repository can be cloned to your computer and the package installed 
from the command line. From Linux this would involve:

``` r
git clone https://github.com/afsc-assessments/spmR
R CMD INSTALL spmR
```

### Option 3

This time from within R using:

``` r
devtools::install("spmR")
```

## Help

Help for all `spmR` functions and data sets can be found on the R help pages 
associated with each function and data set. Help for a specific function can be 
viewed using `?function_name`, for example:

``` r
?run_model
?tab_fit
?plot_sel
```

Alternatively, to see a list of all available functions and data sets use:

``` r
help(package = "spmR")
```

## Examples

The package vignettes are a great place to see what `spmR` can do. You can view 
the package vignettes from within R using:

``` r
browseVignettes(package = "spmR")
vignette(topic = "spmR", package = "spmR")
```

## Website

All of the vignettes and the help pages for each function are bundled together 
and published on the website https://afsc-assessments.github.io/spmR/.

## Developers

Developers will want to do things slightly differently. See the 
`Model development` vignette.
