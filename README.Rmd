## Installation

#### `spmR`

Learn more about this package at this [pkgdown webpage!](https://emilymarkowitz-noaa.github.io/NMFSReports/)

The spmR Package has the basic approach for projecting groundfish fishing scenarios given assessment result inputs.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA/spmR")
library(spmR)

# Or, alternatively, 
remotes::install_github("EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA/NMFSReports@main")
```

#### You may also consider useing this package with `nmfspalette`

A package for NOAA Fisheries color schemes. More info [here](https://github.com/nmfs-general-modeling-tools/nmfspalette). 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("nmfs-general-modeling-tools/nmfspalette")

## Abstract

In about 1999 software to analyze a set of stochastic projection scenarios were developed for application to N. Pacific groundfish stocks.  The requirement to undertake these projections generally included that output from an age-structured population dynamics model was available.

In 2000, the core of this projection model was adapted for application in a multi-species technical interactions framework.  This version of the model treated all species generically, i.e., as if the assessment output were from multi-fishery, split sex, Tier 3 models.  This required partitioning the combined-sex output (typically assuming 50/50 sex ratio) appropriately and configuring the Tier 4 and 5 species as having a Tier 3 equivalent (i.e., pseudo values were input to obtain the same ABC values under a Tier 3 calculation as would be obtained from a lower Tier ABC calculation).  The components of the model were 3-fold: 

  1)	The species-specific part (pertaining to the demographics and current stock size for all target species);

  2)	The fishery-specific part (pertaining to the observed species composition by fishery within areas; and

  3)	The set of constraints (imposed on regulating the relative  increase in fishery effort and/or stock catch levels)

The first component is derived from the individual assessment models.
The second component is based on fishery definitions and observed bycatch levels.
The third component is a set of constraints that are intended to reflect the current management practices for N. Pacific groundfish (e.g., the 2 million t OY limit for the sum of all BSAI groundfish TACs).


Scientists in government and beyond are often tasked with preparing analysis-driven reports that inform policy and are crucial for documenting the state of their programs at regular intervals (e.g., annually, quarterly, monthly). Although these reports typically follow the same format for each iteration, updating content with new data from previous document line by line can lead to inefficient writing and introduce errors. 

Alternatively, R and R Markdown can be used to systematically modernize report creation. To address this need within our agency I have developed a new R package, `{NMFSReports}`, which uses R and R Markdown to provide an analysis-to-product approach to report writing by centralizing back-end data analyses and efficiently streamlining copy-edit and design sub-processes. The `{NMFSReports}` R package first creates the basic report outline and folder architecture to create reproducible reports, and then provides users with grammar and organization helper functions that assist in report writing. To aid in the final publication process, this workflow can also be used to produce intermediate output files for subject matter experts and collaborators to review and use. `{NMFSReports}` can produce copy-edit ready and accessibility-compliant documents for editors, style guide-formatted and flow-in ready text (including bibliography, footnote, figure, and table management) for authors, tables and figures for graphic designers, and web-ready data files for web tool developers. Though this package is in early stages of development, it is already clear it has the potential to save colleagues across our agency countless hours and improve efficiency and consistency among our teams and offices. Though developed for reports produced by scientists at NOAA Fisheries, the concepts and structures behind `{NMFSReports}` have utility for anyone seeking to streamline reports, graphics, and web tools.
